          During the module I was required to complete 4 different practical / research exams, these
          were to test our knowledge and to test our ability to effectively utilise this knowledge
          to solve questions or decrypt the answer. While this method of assessment held 40% of the
          overall mark the other 60% came from a 1500-word report (10% +-) where I was required to
          lay out a threat landscape to an organisation. This report was to include major and small
          threats to this company with ways to mitigate against these threats.

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p className='text'>
          The purpose of this module was an introduction to object-oriented programming using C#.
          The beginning of the module began with very basic teaching of how to set up a procedural
          project with no functions. The module then proceeded to teach the use of data types and
          functions. Software development was used to only teach the fundamentals of OOP languages,
          yet we did not touch upon polymorphism or recursion.
        </p>
        <h4>First Assessment</h4>
        <p className='text'>
          The requirements of this assignment was to construct a game with similar rule set to the
          game Hammurabi. I wrote a post nuclear apocalyptic Hammurabi clone, which I named
          Survivors. Concepts of Survivors:
        </p>
        <ul className='Needed-list'>
          <li>Resources replace grain</li>
          <li>
            At the beginning of each day you must decide how much resources to feed the population.
            Feeding too little will cause people to die by the next day, overfeeding does little to
            nothing
          </li>
          <li>
            To gather resource you can send people out to gather resources in teams of 2. Sending
            out will result in random resources being found, or even more people being found.
            However, you risk losing resources or people doing so
          </li>
          <li>If no people remain in the camp then game is over</li>
          <li>
            You can build radiation kits, these will cure all radiation a person has. A random event
            can happen which can kill a percentage of the population unless they are given radiation
            kits
          </li>
          <li>If you survive 10 days then everyone alive will be rescued and the game will end</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Second Assessment</h4>
        <p className='text'>
          My second assigment for the module requirements were to make a make a connect four game
          using windows forms as the graphical interface. For this assignment I gained 82%, only
          dropping marks for missing out additional features. The main additional feature that I
          left out of the project was to allow to play against the computer. The small feature that
          I left out was an animation to show the tile dropping.

          The first assignement required us to make to make a website design for a leisure centre.
          We were given a scenario where we had to create a design with personas and wireframes to
          design a potential website.

          the first assignment. The hosting for this website is no longer available, but the report
          I developed is still available for download.
